A discord bot that only focuses on discord embeded applications.

This all the id of the application was taken from [
Bendimester23/Discord embedded application codes.md](https://gist.github.com/Bendimester23/98cdabec9dedc18a97d3d2bb68715919)    
So a great thanks to <u>Bendimester23</u> for those ids
